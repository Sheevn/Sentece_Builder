Sentence Builder for Kids
Welcome to Sentence Builder for Kids, a fun and educational web app designed for children up to 10 years old to learn how to build sentences! Kids drag green word blocks into a blue area to create sentences like "The dog runs" or "My big dog is happy." With colorful confetti, playful emojis, and helpful hints, it’s a great way to practice grammar and vocabulary.

Confetti Celebration: Get a burst of colorful confetti when you make a correct sentence! 🎉
Smart Hints: If the sentence is wrong, get tips like "Put the animal word after ‘The’" to help learn.
Progress Tracking: See how many sentences you’ve completed!

How to Play

Start the Game:
You’ll see green word blocks in the "Word Bank" (e.g., "The," "dog," "runs").
The blue "Build Your Sentence Here" area pulses to show where to drag words.


Build a Sentence:
Drag the green blocks to the blue area to form a sentence, like "The dog runs."
Arrange them in the correct order.


Check Your Sentence:

If correct, you’ll see "Great job! 😊🎉" and confetti!
If wrong, you’ll get a hint like "Try: ‘The’, then ‘dog’, then ‘runs’."


Reset or Continue:

After a correct sentence, the app moves to a new one after 2 seconds.
